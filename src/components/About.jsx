        <p>
          I'm <strong>Devirus</strong>, a dedicated Web Developer who builds high-converting 
          websites specifically for <strong>gyms, fitness coaches, and personal trainers</strong>. 
          My mission is simple — help fitness businesses attract more clients, build a strong 
          online brand, and grow with the power of tech.
        </p>

        <p>
          With strong experience in tools like <strong>React.js, Node.js, Express.js,</strong> and 
          modern UI frameworks, I create websites that look clean, load fast, and convert visitors 
          into paying clients. From stunning landing pages to full online coaching platforms, 
          I deliver designs that match the energy and intensity of the fitness world.
        </p>

        <p>
          I blend creativity, performance, and strategy to turn ideas into powerful digital 
          experiences. If you’re a fitness professional who wants to stand out online, I’m here 
          to help you build a website that works as hard as you do.
